Summary of Program:
The program asks user for their IP address and it uses it to find location by latitude and longitude, then it uses that to get the weather in that location for 5 days, specifically temperature in Farienheit and parcipitation levels. 

Most Challenging topic in the course:
Files and Json Files. 

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
When doing the second part where the latitude and longitude were inputed it kept giving the error "{'error': True, 'reason': "Value of type 'Float' required for key 'latitude'."}" even though I tried to make it a float and tried many methods. I wasnt able to complete it in time. The first part works fine with it returing the latitude and longitude.
